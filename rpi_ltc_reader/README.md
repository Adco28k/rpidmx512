# Raspberry Pi Time Code Reader/LTC #

This is a prototype. Currently supported frame rates: 24fps and 25fps

The output is on an external attached monitor. 

Features to be implemented can be : MIDI out, ArtNet out, output on I2C-LCD.

The schematic for the interface will be posted. Basically you need to convert the 1VPP to 3.3V logic.This can easily be done with coupling capacitor, resistors and the CD4050.
